Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Filled me--thrilled me!--with fantastic terrors never felt before
